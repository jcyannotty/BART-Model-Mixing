# Open Bayesian Trees Project
This repository includes new developments with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and extends the original OpenBT repository created by Matt Pratola (https://bitbucket.org/mpratola/openbt/src/master/).
Such extensions include Bayesian Model Mixing and Bayesian Calibration. The first version of the Bayesian Model Mixing software using BART is available for download via the Debian package in this repository.

All of the Bayesian Tree code is written in C++. User interfaces constructed in R and Python allow one to easily run the software.
